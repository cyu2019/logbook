# Logbook

A program originally written by wrxryuu in python, ported to node.js and with new functionality.


To run:

`npm install`

This installs the necessary packages

`node main`

This will generate a settings.json file which you should put your token into. Then do

`node main`

again to actually run the bot.

Do !help to look at all the commands.
